# Interactive math graphs

THIS PROJECT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

Interactive math graphs for easier learning of math concepts

This is a small project for easier teaching or learning of math concepts such as derivatives, integrals, limits...

For now we only have a chart for derivatives.

TODO:
- packages
- demo website with graphs
- add callbacks to coordinate system objects
- make objects movable
- lots of stuff
